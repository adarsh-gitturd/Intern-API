# News API Integration 
This is a fully functional website that fetches real-time data from four different News API outlets, as specified in newsapi.org via an API Key.

* API Provider: News API
* API Documentation: News API Documentation
* Working : The backend server, operating on PORT 5000 with Express/Node, fetches real-time API data from the News API website. The frontend React server, upon integration with the backend via axios, presents this data to the user.
